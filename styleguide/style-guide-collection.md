# Style guides

I’m a word nerd and I love style guides. Learn more about me <https://linktr.ee/barriebyron>.

In my daily work as a technical communicator, I don't have to remember everything. Instead, I just remember where to look for the answers to my many questions. I rely on trusted style guides.

I bookmark frequently visited pages in style guides on my web browser at work. I compiled this easy-to-share list of style guides so that we can all benefit. Feel free to share. Style matters.

## What is a style guide?

A style guide contains a set of standards for writing and designing content. It helps maintain a consistent style, voice, and tone across your technical content. Style guides contain usage rules, best practices, punctuation guidelines, text formatting guidance, and more.

## Why use a style guide?

A canonical set of guidelines to create clear, concise, and consistent technical content for the intended audience.
